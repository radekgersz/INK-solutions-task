# Authentication
All API requests require a valid Bearer Token in the Authorization header. Tokens are obtained via the OAuth2 login flow.

# Rate Limiting
To ensure system stability, the API limits clients to 60 requests per minute. Exceeding this returns a 429 Too Many Requests error.

# Data Format
The API accepts and returns data in JSON format exclusively. Ensure the 'Content-Type' header is set to 'application/json'.

# Versioning
The API uses URL-based versioning. The current stable version should always be included in the path, for example, '/v1/resource'.
