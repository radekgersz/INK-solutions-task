# Connection Handshake
To establish a WebSocket connection, clients must perform a standard HTTP handshake at `wss://api.example.com/v1/stream`. The connection request must include the header `Upgrade: websocket`.

# Heartbeats
To prevent the connection from closing due to inactivity, the server sends a 'ping' frame every 30 seconds. The client must respond with a 'pong' frame within 10 seconds, or the connection will be terminated.

# Message Format
All messages sent and received over the WebSocket are strictly JSON strings. Binary data frames are not supported and will result in an immediate disconnection (Code 1003).

# Reconnection Logic
If a WebSocket connection drops unexpectedly, clients should implement an exponential backoff strategy for reconnection, starting with a 1-second delay and doubling up to a maximum of 60 seconds.
